### Event details:
First meeting of J2. We will have a small potluck so please bring snacks!
As for the topics, we should largely do a review of the chapters covered in class and then cover some new material so please review the items below in preparation if you find time.
New material:
Genki 
Lesson 6 Vocabulary page 148
Lesson 6 Grammar Point 1 (Te-form) page 150

### Thoughts:
Overall we had a great turnout with about close to 10 of our classmates with plenty of snacks, especially of Japanese origin.
I hope to continue to see a consistent turnout before the start of the official J2 summer class.
Balancing work, the official class, and student-run class will take some thought.
